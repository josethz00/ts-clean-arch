# Config

## Config is a folder that contains all the configuration files for the microservice. In this folder you will find the setup of the external services that you will use in the microservice, like Docker, K8S, Husky, CI/CD, etc.

&nbsp;

The configuration files are located in the `config` folder, and they are separated from the rest of the microservice code to keep the microservice as simple as possible, and separated from all the environment stuff.

## Folders

### `docker`

### `husky`
